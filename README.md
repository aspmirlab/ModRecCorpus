# ModRecHub
ModRecHub - An online Hub for Datasets, Algorithms and Models on Modulation Recognition for Communication Systems - Version 2019

<h3>(1) ModRec-SimData_V1</h3>
The link below gives you access to the raw simulated dataset of six Modulation Schemes, namely - 16QAM, 64QAM, BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, and GMSK. All the modulation schemes were curated in the GNU Radio Companion.

<h3>(2) ModRec-MPRCModel_V1</h3>
The following link contains the Automatic Modulation Recognition model developed based on the modulation schemes in (1) above and the Minimum Phase Reconstruction Coefficients (MPRC) descriptor.
