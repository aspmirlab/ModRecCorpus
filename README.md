# ModRecCorpus
ModrecCorpus - A Corpus for Datasets, Algorithms and Models on Modulation Recognition for Communication Systems - Version 2019

<h3>(1) SimModRec2020a_Dataset</h3>
The link below gives you access to the raw simulated dataset of six Modulation Schemes, namely - 16QAM, 64QAM, BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, and GMSK. All the modulation schemes were curated in the GNU Radio Companion.
