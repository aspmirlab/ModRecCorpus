# ModRecHub
ModRecHub - An online hub for Datasets, Algorithms and Models on Modulation Recognition for Communication Systems

<h3>(1) ModRec-SimData_V1</h3>
The link below gives you access to the raw simulated dataset of six Modulation Schemes, namely - 16QAM, 64QAM, BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, and GMSK. All the modulation schemes were curated in the GNU Radio Companion.

<h3>(2) SimModRecV1</h3>
The following link contains i) The Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model developed based on the modulation schemes in (1) above and the Minimum Phase Reconstruction Coefficients (MPRC) descriptor. ii) Sample simulation test dataset. ii) MATLAB Script for testing the model
